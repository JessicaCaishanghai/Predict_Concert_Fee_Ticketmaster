That's why we've done the research for you. We know you deserve the best while visiting the Strip! So, make your way down to the Luxor and check out Carrot Top, Vegas's Best Male Stand-Up Comedian. This guy is an absolute riot, combining comical commentary on current events with outrageous prop comedy. He's got a trunk full of bizarre items, including several of his own inventions, which add an extra layer of hilarity to his jokes. Add in his wacky personality, over-the-top red hair, and the fact that he barely takes the time to breathe between jokes, and you're in for a show that will have you doubled over laughing from start to finish. It's no wonder Carrot Top has been praised as both Entertainer of the Year and Comedian of the Year. His shows are, quite simply, one heck of a good time.

Opening June 2023 at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel & Casino and operating every week of the year, THE HOOK will feature a world-premiere live show, an East Coast home for our awesome Italian-American-Psychedelic Superfrico restaurant, and several discoverable cocktail bars. As Atlantic City's first-ever permanent entertainment residency, The Hook live show is directed by Britain's leading comedy director Cal McCrystal (Atomic Saloon Show, One Man Two Guvnors).

Dubbed the ""Wonder Theatre of the World,"" the building became an East Coast mecca for star-studded entertainment. Now, almost a century later, Spiegelworld is undertaking a multi-million dollar resurrection of THE HOOK, retaining its beautiful, original, ocean-view façade. Opening June 2023 at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel & Casino and operating every week of the year, THE HOOK will feature a world-premiere live show, an East Coast home for our awesome Italian-American-Psychedelic Superfrico restaurant, and several discoverable cocktail bars. As Atlantic City's first-ever permanent entertainment residency, The Hook live show is directed by Britain's leading comedy director Cal McCrystal (Atomic Saloon Show, One Man Two Guvnors). Of course, you can expect Spiegelworld's signature blitz of ridiculous fun, jaw-dropping wow, and sizzling hot superhumans from around the world.",onsale,2025-08-13T23:00:00Z,,2025-08-13,19:00,2025-04-04 14:00:00,2025-08-13 23:00:00,Arts & Theatre,Comedy,Comedy,https://s1.ticketm.net/dam/a/d0a/a966b912-9753-4220-ada1-450056fc5d0a_SOURCE,,,,The Hook,K8vZ917hqOV,https://s1.ticketm.net/dam/a/d0a/a966b912-9753-4220-ada1-450056fc5d0a_SOURCE,The Hook at Caesars Atlantic City,KovZ917Ac6b,2100 Pacific Avenue,Atlantic City,NJ,US,39.3564,-74.436052,08401,America/New_York,https://www.ticketmaster.com/the-hook-tickets/artist/3026955,https://www.ticketmaster.com/the-hook-at-caesars-atlantic-city-tickets-atlantic-city/venue/17210,https://www.ticketmaster.com/the-hook-atlantic-city-new-jersey-08-13-2025/event/0200627FAA6A2CA3,,,,0200627FAA6A2CA3,17210.0,3026955,,,,,ticketmaster,Undefined,Undefined,494,PROMOTED BY VENUE,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7na,KnvZfZ7vAe1,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7vF17,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7nI,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7v7lJ,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7na,Arts & Theatre,KnvZfZ7vAe1,Comedy,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7vF17,Comedy,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7nI,Undefined,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7v7lJ,Undefined,,,True,False,,,,,,2025-04-04T15:00:00Z,The venue reserves the right to implement security procedures designed to protect the experience for all of our customers.

They're among the arsenal of impressions that's made Craig Gass one of comedy's most formidable and flexible talents since he first hit the stand-up circuit in 1993. The story of how Gass developed his ability to impersonate the famous and infamous is nearly as amazing as watching him shape-shift. He grew up in Mt. Vernon, N.Y., with a father, mother, and sister who are all completely deaf. As the sole hearing member of this happy if unconventional family, he learned to speak from copying the voices he heard on TV. His sense of humor and love of performance were evident at an early age. After catching the stand-up bug and cutting his teeth at comedy clubs in the New York area, he caught the attention of Howard Stern, who unleashed him on his listeners. The connections he made also led to gigs on such shows as Sex and the City, Family Guy.",onsale,2025-07-06T01:00:00Z,,2025-07-05,18:00,2025-04-30 17:00:00,2025-07-06 02:00:00,Arts & Theatre,Comedy,Comedy,https://s1.ticketm.net/dbimages/143427a.jpg,,,,Craig Gass|Jimmy Kimmel's Comedy Club - Las Vegas,K8vZ91757S0|K8vZ917QcY7,https://s1.ticketm.net/dbimages/143427a.jpg|https://s1.ticketm.net/dam/a/b46/00337dcc-5bd1-4b00-816c-491561ad4b46_SOURCE,Jimmy Kimmel's Comedy Club,KovZ917AOfZ,3545 S Las Vegas Blvd,Las Vegas,NV,US,36.11793,-115.171531,89109,America/Los_Angeles,https://www.ticketmaster.com/craig-gass-tickets/artist/875438|https://www.ticketmaster.com/jimmy-kimmels-comedy-club-las-vegas-tickets/artist/2927826,https://www.ticketmaster.com/jimmy-kimmels-comedy-club-tickets-las-vegas/venue/467952,https://www.ticketmaster.com/craig-gass-at-jimmy-kimmels-comedy-las-vegas-nevada-07-05-2025/event/3900629C81DA704F,,,,3900629C81DA704F,467952.0,875438|2927826,,,,,ticketmaster,Undefined,Undefined,494,PROMOTED BY VENUE,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7na,KnvZfZ7vAe1,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7vF17,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7nI,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7v7lJ,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7na|KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7na,Arts & Theatre|Arts & Theatre,KnvZfZ7vAe1|KnvZfZ7vAe1,Comedy|Comedy,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7vF17|KZazBEonSMnZfZ7vF17,Comedy|Comedy,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7nI|KZAyXgnZfZ7v7nI,Undefined|Undefined,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7v7lJ|KZFzBErXgnZfZ7v7lJ,Undefined|Undefined,,,True,False,,,,,,2025-04-30T18:00:00Z,Must be 18 and older to attend this event.

Dubbed the ""Wonder Theatre of the World,"" the building became an East Coast mecca for star-studded entertainment. Now, almost a century later, Spiegelworld is undertaking a multi-million dollar resurrection of THE HOOK, retaining its beautiful, original, ocean-view façade.

Dubbed the ""Wonder Theatre of the World,"" the building became an East Coast mecca for star-studded entertainment. Now, almost a century later, Spiegelworld is undertaking a multi-million dollar resurrection of THE HOOK, retaining its beautiful, original, ocean-view façade. Opening June 2023 at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel & Casino and operating every week of the year, THE HOOK will feature a world-premiere live show, an East Coast home for our awesome Italian-American-Psychedelic Superfrico restaurant, and several discoverable cocktail bars. As Atlantic City's first-ever permanent entertainment residency, The Hook live show is directed by Britain's leading comedy director Cal McCrystal (Atomic Saloon Show, One Man Two Guvnors).

DiscoShow celebrates the music and a movement which ignited a decade. The inferno is still burning, burning and you are a VIP guest. Just ask for Mother. DiscoShow is inspired by the spirit of David Mancuso's legendary New York City loft parties at 99 Prince Street; a psychedelic extension of the childhood parties the nuns used to throw at his orphanage. While New York faced its toughest times, and President Ford told the city to drop dead, Mancuso and his friends simply said, let's dance. The DJ stood at the altar, and salvation was found on the dance floor. Disco was born. DiscoShow is unlike any other show in the world. Once you make it past Mother's velvet rope, guests will be in the room with the characters who were there at the height of disco. You can be a bystander and just watch. Or you can lose yourself in the music, and maybe even find yourself.",onsale,2025-06-28T04:00:00Z,,2025-06-27,21:00,2025-02-12 18:00:00,2025-06-28 04:00:00,Arts & Theatre,Performance Art,Performance Art,https://s1.ticketm.net/dam/a/cfa/8728f3e8-92b6-4322-9b78-aaf5ca86ecfa_SOURCE,,,,DiscoShow,K8vZ917j49f,https://s1.ticketm.net/dam/a/cfa/8728f3e8-92b6-4322-9b78-aaf5ca86ecfa_SOURCE,DiscoShow at The Linq,KovZ917Amxf,3535 Las Vegas Blvd S,Las Vegas,NV,US,36.11817,-115.17168,89109,America/Los_Angeles,https://www.ticketmaster.com/discoshow-tickets/artist/3105174,https://www.ticketmaster.com/discoshow-at-the-linq-tickets-las-vegas/venue/467984,https://www.ticketmaster.com/discoshow-las-vegas-nevada-06-27-2025/event/39006247A31F6A85,,,,39006247A31F6A85,467984.0,3105174,,,,,ticketmaster,Undefined,Undefined,494,PROMOTED BY VENUE,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7na,KnvZfZ7v7l6,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7v7l1,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7nI,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7v7lJ,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7na,Arts & Theatre,KnvZfZ7v7l6,Performance Art,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7v7l1,Performance Art,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7lt,Event Style,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7vAAv,Undefined,,,True,False,,,,,,2025-02-12T19:00:00Z,Must be 18 and older and older to attend this event.

THE WIZ returns ""home"" to stages across America in an all-new Broadway-bound tour, the first one in 40 years. This groundbreaking twist on The Wizard of Oz changed the face of Broadway - from its iconic score packed with soul, gospel, rock, and finger-snapping '70s funk to its stirring tale of Dorothy's journey to find her place in a contemporary world. A dynamite infusion of ballet, jazz, and modern pop brings a whole new groove to easing on down the road. Direction by Schele Williams (The Notebook, revival of Disney's Aida), choreography by JaQuel Knight (Beyonce's ""Single Ladies,"" ""Black is King"" and additional material by Tony-nominated and Emmy-nominated writer and TV host Amber Ruffin (""The Amber Ruffin Show,"" ""Late Night With Seth Meyers"") brings a whole new groove to easing on down the road.

Follow in Carter's footsteps, peer through the wall of the antechamber, unlock the burial room, and come face-to-face with the mummy. Behold the artistry of the nested coffins and view Tut's notorious death mask. Discover why the Egyptians used mummification as a way to preserve and honor their pharaoh leader. Enter a world that sparkles with gold and learn what the treasures themselves reveal about the boy king and ancient Egyptian culture. With the audio guide, guests can transport themselves back in time by hearing Howard's own retelling of the moment he first set foot inside the tomb. Light your torch, break the seal, defy the mummy's curse, and enter if you dare.",onsale,,,2025-12-31,,2024-11-08 18:00:00,2026-01-01 03:00:00,Arts & Theatre,Fine Art,Fine Art,https://s1.ticketm.net/dam/a/fe6/f9498132-1719-4784-afe3-8c2ffb412fe6_SOURCE,,,,Discovering King Tut's Tomb,K8vZ917Qluf,https://s1.ticketm.net/dam/a/fe6/f9498132-1719-4784-afe3-8c2ffb412fe6_SOURCE,King Tut: The Exhibition at Luxor Hotel and Casino,KovZ917AIDz,3900 Las Vegas Boulevard South,Las Vegas,NV,US,36.095503,-115.176709,89119,America/Los_Angeles,https://www.ticketmaster.com/discovering-king-tuts-tomb-tickets/artist/2918983,https://www.ticketmaster.com/king-tut-the-exhibition-at-luxor-tickets-las-vegas/venue/376966,https://www.ticketmaster.com/discovering-king-tuts-tomb-las-vegas-nevada-12-31-2025/event/2E00615FB47D8623,,,,2E00615FB47D8623,376966.0,2918983,,,,,ticketmaster,Event Style,Exhibit,494,PROMOTED BY VENUE,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7na,KnvZfZ7v7nl,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7v7ld,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7lt,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7vA6I,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7na,Arts & Theatre,KnvZfZ7v7nl,Fine Art,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7v7ld,Fine Art,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7lt,Event Style,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7vA6I,Exhibit,,,True,False,,,,,,2024-11-08T19:00:00Z,"The Exhibition is open daily from: 10:00AM - 8:00PM | Last Arrival 7:00PM No Food or beverages No Large backpacks, shopping bags, or packages Pets - Guide dogs and other service animals only.

DiscoShow celebrates the music and a movement which ignited a decade. The inferno is still burning, burning and you are a VIP guest. Just ask for Mother. DiscoShow is inspired by the spirit of David Mancuso's legendary New York City loft parties at 99 Prince Street; a psychedelic extension of the childhood parties the nuns used to throw at his orphanage. While New York faced its toughest times, and President Ford told the city to drop dead, Mancuso and his friends simply said, let's dance. The DJ stood at the altar, and salvation was found on the dance floor. Disco was born. DiscoShow is unlike any other show in the world. Once you make it past Mother's velvet rope, guests will be in the room with the characters who were there at the height of disco. You can be a bystander and just watch.

The classic crooner and entertainer even has a road named after him at Vegas' international airport. A consummate performer, Newton has been charming audiences since he was a kid, singing alongside his older brother Jerry. Once the young siblings made their way to Vegas, where they began performing six shows a night, six nights a week, Wayne was on his way to becoming a legend. Over the next several decades, Newton would solidify his VIP status, transforming from the boyish singer of the 60s to the debonair Mr. Entertainer of Vegas. He came to dominate Sin City, at one point becoming its highest paid performer. In total, he's logged over 30,000live shows and counting. The King of Vegas continues his rule, presiding over Bugsy's Cabaret at Flamingo with his intimate show, Wayne Newton: Up Close and Personal, in which he sings his biggest hits, shares his favorite stories and invites the audience to ask him anything.",onsale,2025-06-05T02:00:00Z,,2025-06-04,19:00,2024-12-13 18:00:00,2025-06-05 02:00:00,Music,Pop,Adult Contemporary,https://s1.ticketm.net/dam/a/4df/204c2bb1-567a-446d-bffa-630ddaf064df_SOURCE,,,,Wayne Newton,K8vZ9171GzV,https://s1.ticketm.net/dam/a/4df/204c2bb1-567a-446d-bffa-630ddaf064df_SOURCE,Bugsy's Cabaret at Flamingo,KovZpaF2Qe,3555 Las Vegas Blvd,Las Vegas,NV,US,36.11726269,-115.17272405,89109,America/Los_Angeles,https://www.ticketmaster.com/wayne-newton-tickets/artist/734077,https://www.ticketmaster.com/bugsys-cabaret-at-flamingo-tickets-las-vegas/venue/467855,https://www.ticketmaster.com/wayne-up-close-personal-las-vegas-nevada-06-04-2025/event/39006189C6CB1279,,,,39006189C6CB1279,467855.0,734077,,,,,ticketmaster,Undefined,Undefined,494,PROMOTED BY VENUE,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7nJ,KnvZfZ7vAev,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7vk1l,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7nI,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7v7lJ,KZFzniwnSyZfZ7v7nJ,Music,KnvZfZ7vAev,Pop,KZazBEonSMnZfZ7vk1l,Adult Contemporary,KZAyXgnZfZ7v7nI,Undefined,KZFzBErXgnZfZ7v7lJ,Undefined,,,True,True,To better accommodate your needs the box office has requested that special seating accommodations be solicited through their representatives.,,,,,2024-12-13T19:00:00Z,Ages 5 and older to attend this event.

Once the young siblings made their way to Vegas, where they began performing six shows a night, six nights a week, Wayne was on his way to becoming a legend. Over the next several decades, Newton would solidify his VIP status, transforming from the boyish singer of the 60s to the debonair Mr. Entertainer of Vegas. He came to dominate Sin City, at one point becoming its highest paid performer. In total, he's logged over 30,000live shows and counting.

This guy is an absolute riot, combining comical commentary on current events with outrageous prop comedy. He's got a trunk full of bizarre items, including several of his own inventions, which add an extra layer of hilarity to his jokes. Add in his wacky personality, over-the-top red hair, and the fact that he barely takes the time to breathe between jokes, and you're in for a show that will have you doubled over laughing from start to finish. It's no wonder Carrot Top has been praised as both Entertainer of the Year and Comedian of the Year. His shows are, quite simply, one heck of a good time.

He came to dominate Sin City, at one point becoming its highest paid performer. In total, he's logged over 30,000live shows and counting.

He's got a trunk full of bizarre items, including several of his own inventions, which add an extra layer of hilarity to his jokes. Add in his wacky personality, over-the-top red hair, and the fact that he barely takes the time to breathe between jokes, and you're in for a show that will have you doubled over laughing from start to finish.

While New York faced its toughest times, and President Ford told the city to drop dead, Mancuso and his friends simply said, let's dance. The DJ stood at the altar, and salvation was found on the dance floor. Disco was born. DiscoShow is unlike any other show in the world.
